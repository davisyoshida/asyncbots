Async Bots
=======================

This library provides a simple ``asyncio`` based interface for writing `RTM <https://api.slack.com/rtm>`_ bots for Slack.
Many distinct functions can be run through a single Slack bot plugin, triggered by user defined commands (e.g. ``!myCommand``).

A simple example of a bot can be found in ``examples/simple_bot.py``.
